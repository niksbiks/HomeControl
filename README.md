# HomeControl
A home monitoring system that keeps private data private. Eventually control and automation...

## Very much pre-alpha while things settle down

## Introduction
A simple system to collect and store information in the home about the local environment, temperature, humidity, power consumption, who comes and goes, if mail has been delivered to the mail box and anything else imaginable.
It will also pull in data from external sources like your cloud fitness data, public transportation etc.

The data will be used to display information to help the household.

A longer term goal will be to also control devices in the home, e.g. digital light bulbs. And to add logic and intelligence to use the data to automate as much as possible.

## Installation
To keep your data private, HomeControl should be installed on a small computer in the home that is always running. A cheap Raspberry Pi or similar is preferred.
Please see the INSTALL.md file for details.

## Features
* Privacy, call it the anti-cloud solution
* Simplicity
* Capture data from a MQTT broker
